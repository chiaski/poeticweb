        <blockquote>(Are.na is a website used to connect & discover ideas. It's like Pinterest but with better community, curation, and features. I personally use it as a knowledge repository and as a way of discovering other artists' and designers' influences. Here are some of my favorite Are.na channels on websites and the internet:)
