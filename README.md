​Could we reimagine the internet as a space for creativity, care, and poetry? How can we create spaces and websites that are focused on expression, storytelling, and poetic purposes?

​Almost all the websites we visit are commercial, utilitarian, and overwhelming. The ‘spaces’ we have for ourselves on the internet aren’t entirely ours. We connect with our loved ones, signal our lives, and consume on networks and platforms that capitalize on our attention and market to us rather than truly serve us. Let’s take a step back from this place and be a part of reclaiming a web as a space for expression, love, and storytelling.

​Join us in learning how to conceptualize, code, and publish your own piece of the handmade web. We’ll go through the resources and processes to make your own poetic website; resources will be shared along with starting frameworks you can use. The workshop is beginner-friendly and moreso intended for a non-technical audience interested in exploring the artistic, poetic potential of the web.
