      <h1>Why a poetic web?</h1>

      <p>Almost every website you browse today is maintained by large corporations, seeking to centralize our behavior. They are privately-controlled spaces that act as public ones. Go Google "Create a website" and a million 'site builders' promise you e-commerce solutions, ways to drive traffic, launch your business, build your brand or portfolio, showcase your art... Maybe you even want to do one of these things. We connect to websites but often feel disconected. Notice how many of these relate to attention, a performance, a gathering? (That's not the only takeaway, but a big one.)

        <br><br>

        What is the web today? What can the web be? What can a website be?
      </p>


      <p>The web is only the way it is because people have built it to be this way. It is seemingly strange that today, we seemingly have more tools than ever &mdash; but it seems a 'rarer' act to go out and publish something... but this shouldn't be a surprise. Information is obscured and gated, places where we can express ourselves and connect are often monetized. This is why it is worth moving towards a more handmade web&mdash;one that we've shaped ourselves. After all, the web is only the way it is because people have built it to be this way.</p>

      <p>Once you resist the current standard of what a 'website' in the 'web' looks like today, it is far easier to imagine what a website could be. </p>

      <img src="fun/comp.png">

      <p>A website after all, is fundamentally a vessel. It doesn't even have to serve 'content'. It doesn't have to be shared out to the whole world; it can be a link that only your friends have, or you can keep it all to yourself. It can have pictures and text and other links across multiple pages and even custom interactions, or it can just be a Google Doc. You can gather at a website from anywhere in the world in a single click, and begin sharing different entrypoints to your website by sharing the URL. You can have multiple websites for specific purposes, it doesn't have to host everything. Publishing' your website doesn't have to mean that it's finished; you are free to make an edit and have it appear instantaneously a second later. Or you can never touch it again and let it die. You can remove anything at once. You design the environment. <br>
        <br>A website is essentially a world you design. What will yours be?
      </p>


      <p>A <strong>poetic web</strong> is one that I imagine to be about creativity, expression, and the handmade. A lot of these thoughts resist the current state of the web: incredibly centralized, capital-driven, attention-seeking—far from what we associate with art. </p>

      <br>
      <blockquote>"The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways." &mdash; <a href="http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html" target="_blank">JR Carpenter, March 2015</a></blockquote>

        <h3>Making a Poetic Web</h3>
        <p>I want to think about your existing relationship with the internet and your thoughts about websites. What can a website be, and what doesn't it have to be?
          <br>
          <br>Let go of your existing notions of what the modern web looks like; return to more natural influences, for instance. A website can be anything. Compare it to something abstract, an animal, or another container with specific affordances. Think of qualities that you want in your website. Think of it as a piece of art, like a painting or a poem.
